# Legged Manager: Manager-Based Isaac Gym Training Code for Legged Robot Locomotion






**Legged Manager** is an Isaac Gym based reinforcement learning framework for legged and wheel-legged robot locomotion.

This repository extends the classic `legged_gym + rsl_rl` training stack with an **IsaacLab-style manager architecture**, making robot tasks easier to organize, customize, debug, and reuse.

---

## Highlights

**Manager-based task architecture**

Task logic is split into reusable managers:

  * `ActionManager`
  * `CommandManager`
  * `ObservationManager`
  * `RewardManager`
  * `TerminationManager`
  * `EventManager`

## Supported task

| Task   | Robot | Terrain                  | Policy                     | Status |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------ |
| `go2w` | Go2W  | rough terrain and stairs | DreamWaQ | active |

## Training

Train the Go2W policy:

```bash
cd legged_gym
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task=go2w 
```

Useful options:

```bash
python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task=go2w --num_envs=4096 --max_iterations=10000 --headless
```

---

## Play

Run the latest trained policy:

```bash
cd legged_gym
python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task=go2w --num_envs=8
```

## Logs and checkpoints

Training logs and checkpoints are saved under:

```text

## Manager architecture

The core design of this repository is a **manager-based Isaac Gym environment architecture**.

Classic `legged_gym` is fast and widely used, but when a task becomes complex, environment logic can easily become tightly coupled. Reward functions, observation construction, randomization, command sampling, reset conditions, and action processing may be mixed inside large environment files, making new tasks harder to modify, debug, and compare.

Legged Manager reorganizes the Isaac Gym training pipeline around **configurable manager terms**. Each part of the environment is handled by an independent manager, and each manager dispatches a group of registered terms defined in the task configuration.

```text
ManagerBasedTask
├── ActionManager
├── CommandManager
├── ObservationManager
├── RewardManager
├── TerminationManager
└── EventManager
```

The manager-based design makes the environment easier to extend in several ways:

* new observation terms can be added without rewriting the whole environment;
* reward terms can be enabled, disabled, replaced, or reweighted from configuration;
* termination conditions can be organized as independent safety and reset checks;
* domain randomization can be written as event terms;
* command generators can be replaced for different locomotion tasks;
* different robot tasks can share the same manager infrastructure;
* ablation studies become cleaner because each term has an explicit configuration entry;
* IsaacLab-style modular environment design can be used inside an Isaac Gym training pipeline.

For example, reward terms can be defined as structured configuration items:

```python
class rewards_manager:
    tracking_lin_vel = ManagerTermCfg(
        func=mdp.tracking_lin_vel,
        scale=3.0,
        env_arg=True,
    )

    tracking_ang_vel = ManagerTermCfg(
        func=mdp.tracking_ang_vel,
        scale=1.5,
        env_arg=True,
    )

    orientation = ManagerTermCfg(
        func=mdp.orientation,
        scale=-2.0,
        env_arg=True,
    )
```

Event terms such as friction randomization can also be configured independently:

```python
class events:
    friction = ManagerTermCfg(
        func=mdp.randomize_friction,
        mode="asset_init",
        env_arg=True,
        params={
            "enabled": True,
            "friction_range": [0.2, 1.25],
        },
    )
```

Observation groups can be organized through the observation manager:

```python
class observations:
    class actor(ObsGroup):
        imu = ManagerTermCfg(func=mdp.imu, env_arg=True)
        command = ManagerTermCfg(func="_obs_commands")
        motor = ManagerTermCfg(func=mdp.motor, env_arg=True)
        dof_pos = ManagerTermCfg(func=mdp.dof_pos, env_arg=True)
        action = ManagerTermCfg(func="_obs_actions")
```

This design is especially useful for legged robot reinforcement learning, where training performance depends on many coupled components such as commands, rewards, observations, reset rules, terrain curriculum, and randomization. By turning these components into manager terms, the codebase becomes easier to maintain and more suitable for rapid research iteration.

## Terrain and curriculum

The current terrain configuration supports:

* pyramid slopes;
* random rough slopes;
* stairs up;
* stairs down;
* discrete obstacles;
* curriculum over terrain difficulty;
* height measurement observations for critic input.

The terrain generator can be extended with parkour-style terrain such as gaps, hurdles, beams, corridors, and stepping stones.
